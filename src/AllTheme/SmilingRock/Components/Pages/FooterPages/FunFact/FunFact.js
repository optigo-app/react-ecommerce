                                    The earliest diamonds were found in India in 4th century bc, although the
                                    youngest of these deposits were formed 900 million years ago. A majority
                                    of these early stones were transported along the network of trade routes
                                    that connected India and china, commonly known as the silk road until the
                                    18th century, India was thought to be the only source of diamonds. When
                                    the Indian diamond mines were depleted, the quest for alternate sources
                                    began. Although a small deposit was found in brazil in 1725, the supply
                                    was not enough to meet world demands.

                                    The discovery of diamonds in south Africa played a pivotal role in the
                                    world’s diamond history. Before diamonds were discovered in kimberley,
                                    they were extremely rare, and were only found in small quantities in India
                                    and brazil. Today, south Africa continues to be one of the world’s major
                                    producers, and it is estimated that up to 65% of the world’s diamonds were
                                    mined from an African mine.

                                    Africa’s top diamond producer, botswana sits second in this global list.

                                    officially launching in 1971. Some of the world’s highest-yielding mines
                                    were unearthed in botswana by the mid-1980s. The African country’s

                                    Fourth in the world when it comes to diamond production, Australia began
                                    to mine the stones commercially from 1981.since 1983, Australia’s largest
                                    diamond mine, argyle, an open-pit mine, has been producing a steady stream
                                    of natural coloured diamonds at the rate of more than 12 million carats
                                    per year. Located in the east kimberley region of western Australia, the
                                    rio tinto-owned argyle’s diamonds made up the initial source of the
                                    country’s up-and-coming diamond industry. However, only about 5% of its
                                    production is gem-quality output. In 2013, rio tinto transformed argyle
                                    into an underground mine to extend its life up to 2020, at least.

                                        The ancient romans and greeks believed that diamonds were tears cried by
                                        the gods or splinters from falling stars, and romans believed that
                                        cupid’s arrows were tipped with diamonds (perhaps the earliest
                                        association between diamonds and romantic love).

                                    , the oval is an ideal choice for a customer who likes the look of a round
                                    diamond, but wants something more unique. Oval diamonds have the added
                                    advantage of an elongated shape, which can create the illusion of greater
                                    size. The slender shape can also make the finger of the wearer appear
                                    longer and slimmer, an effect often desired.

                                    square cut with rounded corners, much like a pillow (hence the name). This
                                    classic cut has been around for almost 200 years, and for the first
                                    century of its existence was the most popular diamond shape (similar to
                                    round cut today). Until the early 20th century, the cushion cut diamond
                                    was the de facto diamond shape. The standards for cushion cut vary more
                                    than most other shapes, and personal taste will dictate choice. While
                                    generally less brilliant than round brilliant diamonds, cushion cut

                                    popularity in the 1920's, and could recently be found only in antique
                                    jewellery shops. Around 2002, one hundred years after the first asscher
                                    cut diamond was created, the shape began to make a comeback, spurred on by
                                    cut modifications that gave the shape more brilliance than traditional
                                    asscher cut diamonds.

                                    The creation of a&nbsp;heart-shaped diamond&nbsp;dates back to the late
                                    1400s when the&nbsp;diamond cut&nbsp;was considered a symbol of royalty.
                                    In 1562, the mary queen of scots sent queen elizabeth a&nbsp;heart-shaped
                                    diamond&nbsp;ring, which has gone down in&nbsp;history&nbsp;as one of the

                                    &nbsp;for the month of september. The name sapphire is derived from the
                                    latin word ““saphirus” and the greek word “sapheiros,” both meaning blue.
                                    Some believe that the name sapphire is derived from its association with
                                    the planet saturn..&nbsp;

                                    The ancient greeks and romans also claimed blue sapphires held mystical
                                    powers, giving their owners wisdom and health. In the middle ages, blue
                                    sapphires were often worn by royalty as amulets to ward off evil.

                                    Diamond shape refers to the silhouette or general look of a stone. There
                                    are many different shapes available in the market today, but there are 11
                                    shapes that are purchased most frequently. An important fact to note is
                                    that all shapes that are not a round brilliant are referred to as fancy
                                    shape diamonds. Each shape differs not only in physical form, but in light
                                    return as well. How much sparkle a stone emits is correlated with how many
                                    facets it has and their general pattern. While a round brilliant shape
                                    will emit the most amount of light return because of its ideal facet
                                    pattern, shapes like emerald and asscher, which are step cuts, will not
                                    have as much sparkle but are appealing because of their unique style.

                                    Carat weight is one of the 4cs of diamonds that measures a diamond’s
                                    weight and size. The term "carat" is derived from the carob seeds that
                                    were used to balance scales in ancient times.

                                    Today’s metric carat is equal to 200 milligrams, or one-fifth of a gram,
                                    and there are approximately 142 carats to an ounce. Carats are further
                                    divided into points. There are 100 points in a carat. A half-carat diamond
                                    may be referred to as a 50-point stone.

                                    quality and value. Diamond cut affects some of its optical and physical
                                    properties including how it reflects light and “sparkles.”

                                    Diamond cut refers to how the jeweler physically cuts the diamond stone
                                    into its shape and to the proportions and symmetry that achieve optimal
                                    light dispersion, which affects a diamond’s quality and price.

                                    The best way to see the true color of a diamond is by looking at it
                                    against a white surface. Colorless stones are graded d, e or f. All three
                                    grades are considered colorless but with slightly decreasing transparency.
                                    Color grading continues down through the alphabet, with each letter
                                    designating a slight darker or warmer tint.
